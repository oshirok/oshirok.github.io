Let God be true, and every man a liar.

That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)","6":"Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?","7":"Someone might argue, \"If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?\"","8":"Why not say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say--\"Let us do evil that good may result\"? Their condemnation is deserved.","9":"What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all!

There is no difference,","25":"God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood.
